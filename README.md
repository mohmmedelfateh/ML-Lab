# PCA

## Summary

The `PCA.md` file provides a comprehensive explanation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction and data exploration. It aims to identify the most important features or patterns in a dataset by transforming it into a new set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components.

# Percentile

## Summary

The `Percentile.md` file offers a comprehensive explanation of percentiles, a statistical measure used to describe the distribution of a dataset and determine the relative position of specific data points within that distribution.

## Contents

1. Introduction to Percentiles
2. Calculating Percentiles
   - Relationship to Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs)
3. Common Percentile-Based Measures
   - Median (50th Percentile)
   - Quartiles (25th and 75th Percentiles)
   - Beyond Quartiles (e.g., 90th and 95th Percentiles)
4. Interpolation Methods
   - Linear Interpolation
   - Nearest Rank
5. Applications of Percentiles
   - Outlier Detection
   - Hypothesis Testing
   - Data Visualization

The `Percentile.md` file provides a detailed explanation of percentiles, including their calculation, interpretation, and various applications. It also covers interpolation methods and the role of percentiles in outlier detection, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.
